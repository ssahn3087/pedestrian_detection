The entire project is based on https://github.com/longcw/faster_rcnn_pytorch and https://github.com/jwyang/faster-rcnn.pytorch

Tested on 
PASCAL VOC 2007, COCO 2017, Caltech Pedestrian Detection Benchmark.

Mainly pretrain multi-class detection model and initialize model that detects only pedestrians.
I add triplet loss training impressed by Triplet-based Deep Similarity Learning for Person Re-Identification, ICCV Workshops 2017
paper : https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.03254

This code is built for individual study to detect Pedestrian dataset.
Still need much work.

Thank you.
