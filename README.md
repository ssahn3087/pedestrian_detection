The entire project is based on https://github.com/longcw/faster_rcnn_pytorch

data directory has two link datasets

VOCdevkit2007, CaltechPedestrians

ln -s ~/CaltechPedestrians/extracted  ~/faster_rcnn/data/CaltechPedestrians

ln -s ~/VOCdevkit  ~/faster_rcnn/data/VOCdevkit2007





Use pretrained model 'VGGnet_fast_rcnn_iter_70000.h5' to train CaltechPedestrians dataset

This code is built for individual study to detect Pedestrian dataset.
Still need much work.

Thank you.
